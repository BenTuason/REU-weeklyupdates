            <h2>Week 1</h2>
            <p>
              I got to my dorm around 2:30pm and finished moving everything in my dorm at 4. This week we did orientation, picture day, meeting our advisors, and our first seminar. 
              My advisor is Dr. Rakesh Verma, and everybody in the department does some sort of data related project (ML & AI). Dr. Verma
              does research in NLP and cybersecurity like detecting hate crime, scam email detection, and protecting ML models. The main project 
              that intersted me is trying to come up with an PAC-learnable, efficient, and scalable linear binary separator for negative and postive classes (This is a mouthful, but basically an efficient 
              & scalable SVM for high dimensions). I asked him if it's purely theoretical and he said yes which kinda excited me since I've been really interested in theoretical computer science. From the seminars,
              my favorite was from Dr. Jaspal Subhlok which was making it easier to summarize lecture recordings with slides. Dr. Verma said he needs to talk with other collaborators if I'm allowed to get in the project to work along side them. 
              I haven't gotten an update yet hopefully week 2 I get one. So right now I've been following Sipser's complexity theory part of his thoery of computation lectures and learning theory lecture slides from CMU. I also found 4 papers 
             which I thought were relevant but we'll see! So overall a good first week :)

            <h2>Week 2</h2>
            <p>
                I finally got approved for my project! I can't speak much on it since I'm not sure if I'm allowed to. But the project is related to theoretical computer science and learning theory (PAC-Learning & VC-dimensions).
                I've been getting to know a lot of my REU members and I'm really happy to have them as new friends! I've been programming mostly in python but since I don't have actual experiments, they're more about testing
                our hypothesis and simulating ideas to help us to formalize our thoughts. I've been asking a lot of questions and meeting basically every day with Dr. Verma. I've discovered that theoretical CS research is a lot of
                coming up with an idea with paper or a whiteboard and discussing if it works, come up with counterexamples, test it by programming or doing small cases of n, program it, then prove it. This isn't the entire process, 
                but it's a good idea of TCS research works. I haven't done any proof yet but I've been reading A LOT of proofs and reading a lot of other mathematically intensive papers which is cool because there's a lot of cool symbols :p
                But week 2 was super super sucessful and lots of progress on stablizing my foundational understanding of the problem and this is the first step of understanding TCS completely!
